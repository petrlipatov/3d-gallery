## Desc

An interactive 3D experience built using React Three Fiber (R3F) and Three.js. The project showcases dynamic animations, smooth transitions, and responsive layouts optimized for various screen sizes. 

## Initial problem 

When manipulating hundreds of objects in 3D space, libraries (GSAP, React-Spring) create long tasks lasting up to 1000 ms. In this R3F demo, I solved the issue by using native Three.js methods, reserving spring animations for smaller, precise tasks. This reduced performance bottlenecks and ensured smooth, responsive interactions, even in complex 3D scenes.
